Try correcting the footer position. The footer is positioned partially outside the window, too far down.

Here are some possible solutions if needed.

Of course, let's examine the possible reasons why your footer is shifted downwards and how to resolve this problem.

Possible Causes

Insufficient content on the page: If your page's content is too short, the footer may end up at the bottom of the browser window instead of at the bottom of the content.
Incorrect use of position: absolute or position: fixed: These CSS properties can take an element out of the normal flow of the page, which can lead to positioning issues.
Incorrect margins or padding: Large margins or padding on elements above the footer can push it down.
Incorrectly set min-height or height on the main container: If your page's main container has a fixed or minimum height that doesn't fit the content, this can affect the footer's positioning. Unresolved Float Issues: Using floats and not properly clearing them can cause layout issues.
Possible Solutions

Sticky Footer Solution

This method ensures that the footer always stays at the bottom of the browser window, even if the page content is short.

HTML Structure:

HTML

<body>
<div class="page-container">
<div class="content-wrap">
</div>
<footer class="footer">
</footer>
</div>
</body>
CSS:

CSS

body {
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
min-height: 100vh; /* Ensures the body takes up at least the full height of the window */
margin: 0;
}

.page-container {
flex: 1; /* Allows content to expand to fill the available space */
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
}

.content-wrap {
flex: 1; /* Allows content to expand to fill the available space */
}

.footer {
background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Background color for the footer */
padding: 20px;
text-align: center;
}
Using position: relative and bottom: 0 (if applicable)

If you want the footer to always be at the bottom of the parent container, you can use position: relative on the parent container and position: absolute with bottom: 0 on the footer.

CSS:

CSS

.container {
position: relative;
min-height: 100vh; /* Ensure the container takes up at least the full height of the window */
}

.footer {
position: absolute;
bottom: 0;
width: 100%;
background-color: #f0f0f0;
padding: 20px;
text-align: center;
}
Checking Margins and Padding

Inspect the elements above the footer to ensure they don't have excessive margins or padding that push the footer down.

Cleaning Up Floats

If you use floats, make sure you clean them up properly by using the clearfix method or by adding overflow: auto or overflow: hidden to the parent container.

Additional Tips

Use browser developer tools: Your browser's developer tools (usually accessible by pressing F12) are extremely useful for inspecting elements, viewing applied styles, and identifying layout issues.
Simplify your code: If you have a lot of complex CSS, try simplifying it to make debugging easier.
Use a CSS framework: Frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation can help you manage layout and avoid common issues.
