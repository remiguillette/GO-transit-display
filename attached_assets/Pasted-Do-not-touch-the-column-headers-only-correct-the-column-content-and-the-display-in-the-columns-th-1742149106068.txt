Column 1 (Leftmost): Scheduled / Programmé
This column indicates the scheduled time.
This column will show the scheduled time, for example: 10:00, 14:30.

Column 2 (Second column): To / À
This column indicates the direction of travel or destination.
This column might contain words like "Name_station ", 
and icon ligne (LW) (LE) (BR) and other   {icon, Name_station} is ligne name 

Column 3 (Third column): Stop / Arrêts
This column indicates the destination or stops along the route.
This column likely displays names of locations or destinations.

Understanding the "Stops" Section
The "Stops" section on the Go Transit display lists the intermediate stations where the train will stop between the origin (where the display is located) and the final destination.
Logic Behind Station Selection
Here's the breakdown of what determines which stations are displayed:
 * Direction of Travel: The display only shows stops that are along the train's route after it departs from the station where the display is located. It doesn't show stops the train has already made before arriving at that station.
 * Key or Major Stops: The display typically lists the most significant stops or major transfer points along the route. It's not designed to show every single stop, especially if there are numerous small stations.
 * Destination Proximity: The closer the train is to its final destination, the more likely the display will show the immediately upcoming stops. This helps passengers know when to prepare to disembark.
 * Display Limitations: The display has limited space. It needs to fit information concisely. Therefore, it might only show a subset of the most relevant stops.
 * Predefined Selection: Go Transit likely has a predefined list of "key" or "major" stops for each route. These are the ones prioritized for display.

   * Determine the train's direction based on the route and the origin station.
   * Filter the list of all stations to include only those after the origin station in the direction of travel.
   * Select the "key" or "major" stops from the filtered list.
   * If using real-time data, adjust the displayed stops based on the train's current position to show the next upcoming stops.

Let's say a train is going from Toronto Union Station to Aldershot.
 * Route Data: The route data would list all stations in order (e.g., Union, Exhibition, Mimico, Long Branch, etc., up to Aldershot).
 * Key Stops: The route data would also indicate that, for example, Exhibition, Mimico, and Oakville are key stops.
 * Display Logic: When the train is at Union Station, the display would show Exhibition, Mimico, and Oakville (or similar key stops) as the "Stops." As the train passes Exhibition, the display might then show Mimico, Oakville, and Burlington.

Column 4 (Rightmost): Platform / Quai
This column indicates the platform number or location where the train or vehicle will arrive or depart.
"Platform" is the English heading, and "Quai" is the French equivalent.
This column likely displays numerical or alphabetical identifiers for platforms (e.g., 1, 2, A, B).




Current Behavior:
The train display screen, when a station is selected, only shows trains in one direction (currently limited to Union Station's trains).
Trains are not displayed in a comprehensive, chronological order.
Estimated arrival times for upcoming trains are not consistently displayed.
Expected Behavior:
The screen should display all trains (both arrivals and departures) for the selected station, regardless of direction.
Trains should be listed in chronological order, with those currently at the platform appearing first.
Upcoming trains should be displayed with their estimated arrival/departure times.
The station must display both directions.
